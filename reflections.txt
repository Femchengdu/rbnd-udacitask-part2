# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

# A total of 14 hours working on it; about 2 hours a daily.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

# I got stuck early in the project with the 'add' method,
# so I had to go do some research on arrays to figure out that 'nil' and '""' aren't the same thing in an array.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

# I added added the 'table_print' gem because it made manipulating the list object easier.

# I added a second add method that uses the output from the 'table_print' gem.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

# I need to know when I have reached the limit of my understanding and look for help online. I often  spend way too much time trying to solve a problem on # my own instead of addmitting that I don't quite know what I am doing and need some help
