# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

# A total of 14 hours working on it; about 2 hours daily.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

# I got stuck early in the project with the 'add' method,
# so I had to go do some research on arrays to figure out that 'nil' and '""' aren't the same thing in an array.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

# I added the change priority method to make it easier for the user to modify a todo item as his or her priorities change.

# I added a second method to delete multiple items from the list as a means to make it faster and easier to manage the list.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

# I need to know when I have reached the limit of my understanding and look for help online. I often  spend way too much time trying to solve a problem on # my own instead of addmitting that I don't quite know what I am doing and need some help
